Before using Bugbot Loop, you need to ensure you have the necessary tools and permissions configured.

## Required tools

### GitHub CLI

Bugbot Loop requires the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) to be installed and authenticated.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install GitHub CLI">
    Visit [https://cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

    Alternatively, you can install using a package manager:

    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew install gh

    # Windows
    winget install --id GitHub.cli

    # Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
    sudo apt install gh
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate with GitHub">
    After installation, authenticate with your GitHub account:

    ```bash
    gh auth login
    ```

    Follow the prompts to complete authentication.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Confirm the GitHub CLI is working:

    ```bash
    gh --version
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Required permissions

You must enable permissions for the following commands in Claude Code:

### GitHub CLI commands

<Warning>
  When Claude Code prompts you to allow these commands, you must approve them for Bugbot Loop to function.
</Warning>

- **`gh api graphql`** - Executes GraphQL queries to fetch and resolve PR comment threads
- **`gh repo view`** - Retrieves repository information (owner and name)
- **`gh pr view`** - Gets PR details, diffs, and status
- **`gh pr checks`** - Monitors Bugbot CI completion status

### Shell commands

- **`sleep`** - Required in auto-commit mode to wait between Bugbot CI polling attempts

### Git operations

<Note>
  These permissions are only required if you use auto-commit mode.
</Note>

In auto-commit mode, you need permissions for:

- **Committing changes** - Creates commits with bug fixes
- **Pushing to remote** - Pushes commits to trigger Bugbot re-runs

If you use manual mode, you don't need commit or push permissions since you'll handle those operations yourself.

## Environment requirements

### PR branch

You must be on a PR branch when running Bugbot Loop. The plugin verifies this during Phase 0 and will stop if you're not on a PR branch.

### Active PR

The branch must have an active pull request on GitHub. Bugbot Loop uses `gh pr view` to retrieve PR details, which will fail if no PR exists for the current branch.

### Bugbot CI enabled

Your repository must have the Cursor Bugbot CI check configured. In auto-commit mode, the plugin waits for the "Cursor Bugbot" check to complete.

## Permission troubleshooting

If you encounter permission errors:

1. **Check Claude Code permissions**: Review allowed commands in Claude Code settings
2. **Verify GitHub CLI authentication**: Run `gh auth status` to confirm you're logged in
3. **Test commands manually**: Try running the required `gh` commands in your terminal to identify issues
4. **Repository access**: Ensure you have write access to the repository for commit and push operations
