## What is Bugbot Loop?

Bugbot Loop is a Claude Code plugin that automatically resolves Cursor Bugbot PR comments in a loop until all issues are addressed. Instead of manually fixing each Bugbot comment one by one, Bugbot Loop processes all unresolved comments, applies fixes, and repeats the cycle until your PR is clean.

The plugin uses the GitHub CLI with GraphQL queries to fetch unresolved Bugbot comments, analyze them, and either fix valid issues or dismiss invalid reports. It supports both automated and manual workflows to fit your development process.

## How it works

Bugbot Loop uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`) with predefined GraphQL queries to fetch unresolved comments left by Cursor Bugbot on your PR. Once it identifies unresolved comments, it:

1. Reads the file context at each comment location
2. Analyzes the Bugbot suggestion
3. Either fixes valid bugs or dismisses invalid reports
4. In auto-commit mode: commits, pushes, marks comments as resolved, and loops back
5. In manual mode: reports changes for your review before committing

The loop continues until all Bugbot comments are resolved or the maximum iteration limit is reached.
