This guide walks you through using Bugbot Loop to resolve Cursor Bugbot comments on your first PR.

## Basic usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your PR branch">
    Make sure you're on a branch with an open pull request that has Bugbot comments. You can check your current branch and PR status with:

    ```bash
    git branch --show-current
    gh pr view
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Bugbot Loop">
    Execute the basic command in Claude Code:

    ```bash
    /bugbot-loop:run
    ```

    The plugin will prompt you to choose between auto-commit mode and manual mode.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose your mode">
    **Auto-commit mode**: The plugin will commit, push, wait for Bugbot to run again, and loop automatically until all comments are resolved.

    **Manual mode**: The plugin will fix all current comments, then stop for you to review the changes before committing.

    <Tip>
      For your first time, try manual mode to see what changes Bugbot Loop makes before committing them.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the results">
    Bugbot Loop will:
    - Fetch all unresolved Bugbot comments using the GitHub API
    - Read the context around each comment
    - Fix valid issues or dismiss invalid reports
    - In auto-commit mode: commit, push, and mark comments as resolved
    - In manual mode: report the changes for your review
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced usage

### Skip the mode prompt

If you already know which mode you want, skip the prompt:

```bash
# Run in auto-commit mode without prompting
/bugbot-loop:run --auto

# Run in manual mode without prompting
/bugbot-loop:run --manual
```

### Set maximum iterations

Control how many times the loop runs before stopping (default is 10):

```bash
/bugbot-loop:run --max-iterations=5
```

### Combine flags

You can combine multiple flags:

```bash
/bugbot-loop:run --auto --max-iterations=3
```

## Understanding the modes

### Auto-commit mode

In auto-commit mode, Bugbot Loop:
1. Waits for Bugbot CI to complete (up to 25 minutes)
2. Fetches unresolved comments
3. Fixes all valid issues
4. Commits and pushes changes
5. Resolves the comment threads on GitHub
6. Loops back to step 1 until all comments are resolved or max iterations reached

<Note>
  Auto-commit mode requires git commit and push permissions enabled in Claude Code.
</Note>

### Manual mode

In manual mode, Bugbot Loop:
1. Fetches all current unresolved comments
2. Fixes all valid issues
3. Reports the changes to you
4. Stops and waits for you to review, commit, and push
5. You can run the command again after Bugbot runs to process the next batch

## What happens next

After Bugbot Loop processes comments:

- **Fixed issues** are applied to your code with proper context
- **Dismissed issues** are logged with explanations of why they were invalid
- In auto-commit mode, resolved threads are automatically marked as resolved on GitHub
- The loop continues until Bugbot is satisfied or the iteration limit is reached

<Tip>
  If Bugbot Loop introduces new issues while fixing others, the next Bugbot run will catch them, and the loop will continue fixing until everything is resolved.
