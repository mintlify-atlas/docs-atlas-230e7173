## Overview

The `/bugbot-loop:run` command resolves Cursor Bugbot PR comments on your current branch. You must be on a PR branch with Bugbot comments to use this command.

## Basic usage

Run the command on a PR branch with Bugbot comments:

```bash
/bugbot-loop:run
```

This will prompt you to choose between auto-commit and manual mode, then process all unresolved Bugbot comments.

## Command variations

### Set max iterations

Limit the number of loop iterations (default is 10):

```bash
/bugbot-loop:run --max-iterations=5
```

### Skip mode prompt

Run directly in auto-commit mode without prompting:

```bash
/bugbot-loop:run --auto
```

Run directly in manual mode without prompting:

```bash
/bugbot-loop:run --manual
```

### Combine flags

You can combine the max iterations flag with a mode flag:

```bash
/bugbot-loop:run --auto --max-iterations=3
```

## Prerequisites

<Note>
Before running this command, ensure you have the following permissions and tools configured.
</Note>

Required tools:
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) installed and authenticated

Required permissions in Claude Code:
- `gh api graphql`
- `gh repo view`
- `gh pr view`
- `gh pr checks`
- `sleep` shell command
- Git commit and push permissions (only if using auto-commit mode)

## How it works

The command uses the GitHub CLI with predefined GraphQL queries to:

1. Verify you're on a PR branch
2. Fetch unresolved Bugbot comments
3. Analyze and fix valid issues (or dismiss invalid ones)
4. In auto-commit mode: commit, push, wait for Bugbot, and repeat
5. In manual mode: make fixes and stop for your review

The loop continues until all comments are resolved or the max iteration limit is reached.
