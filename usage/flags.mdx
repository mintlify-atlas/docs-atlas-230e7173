## Available flags

Bugbot Loop supports several command-line flags to customize its behavior.

<ParamField path="--max-iterations" type="number" default="10">
  Maximum number of loop iterations before stopping.

  In auto-commit mode, this limits how many times the tool will commit, push, wait for Bugbot, and process new comments. This prevents infinite loops if Bugbot continues finding issues.

  ### Example

  ```bash
  /bugbot-loop:run --max-iterations=5
  ```

  <Note>
  If the max iteration limit is reached, the tool will stop and report the current status, even if unresolved comments remain.
  </Note>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--auto" type="boolean">
  Run in auto-commit mode without prompting.

  Enables fully automated operation where the tool commits, pushes, waits for Bugbot CI, resolves threads, and loops until all comments are addressed or max iterations is reached.

  ### Example

  ```bash
  /bugbot-loop:run --auto
  ```

  ### What happens

  - Skips the mode selection prompt
  - Automatically commits and pushes fixes
  - Waits for Bugbot CI to complete (up to 25 minutes per iteration)
  - Resolves comment threads after successful push
  - Continues looping until done

  <Warning>
  This flag will automatically commit and push changes to your PR branch. Ensure you have the necessary git permissions enabled.
  </Warning>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--manual" type="boolean">
  Run in manual mode without prompting.

  Fixes all current Bugbot comments and stops for user review. Does not commit, push, or resolve threads automatically.

  ### Example

  ```bash
  /bugbot-loop:run --manual
  ```

  ### What happens

  - Skips the mode selection prompt
  - Fixes all current unresolved comments
  - Reports changes to you
  - Stops without committing or pushing
  - You manually review, commit, push, and re-run the command

  <Note>
  In manual mode, you control the commit-push cycle. This gives you full oversight but requires running the command multiple times to resolve all issues.
  </Note>
</ParamField>

## Combining flags

You can combine multiple flags in a single command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Auto mode with custom iterations
/bugbot-loop:run --auto --max-iterations=3
```

```bash Manual mode with custom iterations
/bugbot-loop:run --manual --max-iterations=7
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Do not use both `--auto` and `--manual` in the same command. If both are present, behavior is undefined.
</Warning>

## Default values

When flags are omitted:

- **No mode flag** (`--auto` or `--manual`): You'll be prompted to choose a mode
- **No `--max-iterations`**: Defaults to 10 iterations

## Examples

### Basic usage with defaults

```bash
/bugbot-loop:run
```

Uses max-iterations=10 and prompts for mode selection.

### Quick auto-commit run

```bash
/bugbot-loop:run --auto
```

Runs in auto-commit mode with default 10 iterations.

### Careful manual review with low limit

```bash
/bugbot-loop:run --manual --max-iterations=1
```

Fixes current comments only, then stops for your review (effectively one pass).
