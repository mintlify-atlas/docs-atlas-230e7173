## Overview

Bugbot Loop operates in two distinct modes that control how it handles commits and iterations. You can select a mode interactively or specify it using command-line flags.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Auto-commit">
    **Auto-commit mode** runs a fully automated loop that commits, pushes, waits for Bugbot, and repeats until all comments are resolved.

    ### What it does

    1. **Fixes current comments** - Addresses all unresolved Bugbot comments
    2. **Commits changes** - Creates a commit describing what was fixed
    3. **Pushes to remote** - Pushes commits to the PR branch
    4. **Waits for Bugbot CI** - Polls the PR checks until Bugbot completes (up to 25 minutes)
    5. **Resolves threads** - Marks processed comment threads as resolved via GraphQL
    6. **Loops** - Repeats the process until no unresolved comments remain or max iterations is reached

    ### When to use

    Use auto-commit mode when:
    - You trust the automated fixes
    - You want a hands-off approach to resolving Bugbot comments
    - You're comfortable with automatic commits to your PR
    - You want to resolve all issues in one go without manual intervention

    ### How to enable

    ```bash
    /bugbot-loop:run --auto
    ```

    Or select "Auto-commit" when prompted.

    <Warning>
    Auto-commit mode will automatically commit and push changes to your PR branch. Review your repository permissions to ensure git commit and push operations are allowed.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manual">
    **Manual mode** fixes all current Bugbot comments and then stops, allowing you to review changes before committing.

    ### What it does

    1. **Fixes current comments** - Addresses all unresolved Bugbot comments
    2. **Reports changes** - Shows you which files were modified and which comments were dismissed
    3. **Stops** - Does NOT commit, push, or resolve threads
    4. **Waits for you** - Instructs you to review, commit, push, and re-run the command after Bugbot runs again

    ### When to use

    Use manual mode when:
    - You want to review all changes before committing
    - You prefer to control the commit message and timing
    - You want to make additional changes alongside Bugbot fixes
    - You're working on a sensitive codebase where changes need careful review

    ### How to enable

    ```bash
    /bugbot-loop:run --manual
    ```

    Or select "Manual" when prompted.

    ### Workflow

    After running in manual mode:

    1. Review the changes made by Bugbot Loop
    2. Make any additional modifications if needed
    3. Commit and push your changes
    4. Wait for Bugbot CI to run on your new commit
    5. Run `/bugbot-loop:run --manual` again to process the next batch of comments

    <Note>
    Manual mode requires you to handle the commit-push-wait cycle yourself. This gives you full control but requires more iterations to fully resolve all issues.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Choosing a mode

If you don't specify `--auto` or `--manual`, the command will ask you which mode to use with a description of what each does.

## Default behavior

Both modes:
- Read file context before making changes
- Either fix valid Bugbot suggestions or dismiss invalid ones
- Track which comments have been processed
- Never add coauthor lines to commits
